    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is often taught at the academic level from the perspective of computational linguists. However, as data scientists, we have a richer view of the natural language world - unstructured data that by its very nature has latent information that is important to humans. NLP practioners have benefited from machine learning techniques to unlock meaning from large corpora, and in this class we’ll explore how to do that particularly with Python and with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). \n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is an excellent library for machine-learning based NLP, written in Python by experts from both academia and industry. Python allows you to create rich data applications rapidly, iterating on hypotheses. The combination of Python + NLTK means that you can easily add language-aware data products to your larger analytical workflows and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Overview of NLTK\n",
    "NLTK stands for the Natural Language Toolkit and is written by two eminent computational linguists, Steven Bird (Senior Research Associate of the LDC and professor at the University of Melbourne) and Ewan Klein (Professor of Linguistics at Edinburgh University). NTLK provides a combination of natural language corpora, lexical resources, and example grammars with language processing algorithms, methodologies and demonstrations for a very pythonic \"batteries included\" view of Natural Language Processing.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, NLTK is perfect for researh driven (hypothesis driven) workflows for agile data science. Its suite of libraries includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tokenization, stemming, and tagging\n",
    "- chunking and parsing\n",
    "- language modeling\n",
    "- classification and clustering\n",
    "- logical semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK is a useful pedagogical resource for learning NLP with Python and serves as a starting place for producing production grade code that requires natural language analysis. It is also important to understand what NLTK is _not_:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Production ready out of the box\n",
    "- Lightweight\n",
    "- Generally applicable\n",
    "- Magic\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK provides a variety of tools that can be used to explore the linguistic domain but is not a lightweight dependency that can be easily included in other workflows, especially those that require unit and integration testing or other build processes. This stems from the fact that NLTK includes a lot of added code but also a rich and complete library of corpora that power the built-in algorithms. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Syntactic Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "    - No included grammar (not a black box)\n",
    "    - No Feature/Dependency Parsing\n",
    "    - No included feature grammar\n",

    "- Lots of extra stuff (heavyweight dependency)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - papers, chat programs, alignments, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the good and the bad parts will help you explore NLTK further - looking into the source code to extract the material you need, then moving that code to production. We will explore NLTK in more detail in the rest of this notebook. \n",

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced the decision at a joint news conference Friday at 7 World Trade Center. “We have to do more,” Cuomo said. “It’s too serious of a situation to leave it to the honor system of compliance.” They said that public-health officials at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty international airports, where enhanced screening for Ebola is taking place, would make the determination on who would be quarantined. Anyone who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be quarantined. In addition, anyone who traveled there but had no such contact would be actively monitored and possibly quarantined, authorities said. This news came a day after a doctor who had treated Ebola patients in Guinea was diagnosed in Manhattan, becoming the fourth person diagnosed with the virus in the United States and the first outside of Dallas. And the decision came not long after a health-care worker who had treated Ebola patients arrived at Newark, one of five airports where people traveling from West Africa to the United States are encountering the stricter screening rules.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary responsibility you will have before any task involving NLP is to ingest and transform raw text into a corpus that can then be used for performing further evaluations. NLTK provides many corpora for you to work with for exploration, but you must become able to design and construct your own corpora, and to implement `nltk.CorpusReader` objects - classes that in a memory safe and efficient way are able to read entire corpora and analyze them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many people get away with the `nltk.PlainTextCorpusReader` - which uses built-in taggers and tokenizers to deal with raw text. However, this methodology leaves you at the mercy of the tagging model that you have provided, and does not allow you to make corrections that are saved in between runs. Instead you should preprocess your text to allow it to be read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader` or the penultimate corpus, the `nltk.corpus.BracketParseCorpusReader`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will transform raw text into a format that can then be read by the `nltk.corpus.TaggedCorpusReader`. See the documentation at [http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.corpus.reader.html](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.corpus.reader.html) for more information on this reader. \n",

    "Note that you will have to process these files and remove HTML tags and you might have to do other tasks related to the clean up; to do this I suggest you use the third party library BeautifulSoup which can be found at [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/).

    "\n",
    "You should then write a program that uses an NLTK parser and the grammar you constructed that will return a syntactic tree if the input is a noun phrase or None if the input is ungrammatical. Your program will have to take the input sentence, tokenize it and then tag it according to the lexicon (you can assume that words in this lexicon do not have multiple senses) - you'll then have to pass the grammar phrase (the tags) to the parser.\n",
